BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
    See the INSTALL file for a description of the components and instructions
    for building this package.

TESTING
    After installation, try ./runall.sh -c (#cores/node)

    This script will test all the "apps" on 1, 4, and 16 nodes and
    provide some timing information.  Don't take the timing data too
    seriously, as these are rather small runs.

DOCUMENTATION
    Run 'doxygen' in this directory and then point your browser at ./html/index.html
    Here is the beginning of the front page of the bale documentation. Please see
    the documentation for more!

    The bale effort is, first and foremost, a vehicle for discussion.
    Central to bale is a directory of "apps" that exhibit interesting
    communication patterns and programming demands. They allow us to
    test and exchange ideas with others. We hope the bale discussion
    can lead to improved programmer productivity (including existing
    and/or new programming models) and performance.

    - Part of bale is to keep revisiting the question of ``How would
    we like to write this code?''.
 
    - We think all of us want to write programs that are simple,
    elegant, and look like the algorithms they are implementing. In
    bale, we call this (obviously subjective) ideal the AGI model
    (``As God Intended''). For each app, we have included our current
    best effort at an AGI implementation -- this usually makes heavy
    use of single word gets and puts.
 
    - We want something worthy of being called AGI, but with an
    acceptable fraction of the ``gold standard'' (highest possible
    performing) implementation. bale purposely does not define
    "acceptable" or "performance". We want to shrink the gap and
    explore the continuim between high productivity and high
    performance. bale is not meant to be a benchmark.
 
    bale is released under the 3-clause BSD license to try to
    encourage others to join this discussion.
