# bale

Bale is a collection of code meant as a vehicle for discussion for parallel programming models. For more details see bale_classic's [README.md](src/bale_classic/README.md).

The src directory contains bale_classic, which is the original
instance of bale. The src directory also contains several "cousins" of
bale in "other_serial" and "other_parallel". These cousins imitate
bale in one way or another (usually they implement the "apps"
directory in bale_classic) and are written in other languages or are
just a different take. Each of these cousin directories is a separate
project and comes with its own build and run instructions. Check out the README files at the top of each project to get started.
