# toposort

The toposort application is a step up in complexity from histogram and indexgather.
Depending on its input, it typically enjoys a significant amount of parallelism, but it 
is not completely order and latency tolerant.
The input to toposort is a sparse matrix A where A is "morally upper-triangular".

To prepare the input to the toposort algorithm, 
we start we an upper-triangular matrix *T* with no zeros on the diagonal. 
We don't care about the values of the non-zeros in the matrix, only their position.
Next we randomly permute the rows and columns of *T* to get a matrix *M*. 
The matrix *M* has been called a morally triangular matrix.

Given a morally triangular matrix, *M*, the goal of toposort is 
to create row and column permutations such that when these 
permutations are applied to *M*,
the result is an upper triangular matrix with no zeros on the diagonal.
Note, the answer need not be unique and since *M* is a row and column permutation
of *T*, there must be a solution.

We use a breadth first search algorithm based on the following observations:

* The rows (and columns) of a sparse matrix partition the set of non-zeros in the matrix.
* Row and column permutations preserve both partitions.

For example, if you create a set of the nonzeros in a particular row;
a column permutation might change the labels of the elements in the set,
but doesn't change the cardinality of the set. Likewise for columns.
Hence, there must be a row in *M* with a single non-zero.
If we remove that row and column, 
we are left with smaller, morally upper triangular matrix. This is the motivation behind a simple algorithm.

The outline of the algorithm is as follows:

* For all rows with a single non-zero, put its non-zero onto a queue.
* While the queue is not empty: 
   * pop a non-zero from the queue (this represents row r and column c)
   * claim its new position as the last row and column of the permutations being created 
   * remove all the non-zeros in column c
   * if any row now has a single non-zero, enqueue that non-zero

Rather than changing the matrix by deleting rows and column and then searching the 
new matrix for the next row.  We do the obvious thing of keeping and array of row counts,
*rowcnt[i]* is the number of non-zeros in *row i* and
we use a cool trick to find the column of a row with *rowcnt[i]* equal 1.
We initialize an array, *rowsum[i]*, to be the sum of the column indices in * row i*.
When we "delete" a column we decrement *rowcnt[i]* and *rowsum[i]* by that column index.
Hence, when the *rowcnt[i]* gets down to one, the *rowsum[i]* is the column that is left.

In parallel there are three race conditions or synchronization issues to address..

The first is reading and writing the queue of rows to be processed.
One way to handle it is to introduce the notion of a levels.
Within a level all threads process the all the rows on their queues 
and by doing so create new degree one rows. These rows are placed on the 
appropriate queues for the next level. There is a barrier between levels.

Threads race to pick their position in *rperm* and *cperm*. 
One could handle this race for the pivots with a fetch_and_add,
instead we use parallel prefix to claim enough room for the pivots 
in the current level on each thread then assign them in order per thread.
   
Threads race to update the *rowcnt* and *rowsum* arrays. 
We handle this with levels and atomic memory operations.
