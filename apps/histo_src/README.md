# histo (or histogram)

This is the simplest application in bale. It is important because it represents a pattern of communication that is frequently used in parallel applications. This pattern is where PEs are asynchronously sending lots of small data to other PEs. The histogram app in bale is a special case of this, where the data being tranferred is an index into a distributed table and the action we wish to perform is to increment that table's value at that index.

In SHMEM, this looks like

    for(i = 0; i < N; i++)
      shmem_atomic_add(&table[index[i], 1);

where table is a distributed array and index is a local array of indices into table.

Clearly, it does not matter what order the updates are done in the histogram application, in fact there are no dependencies at all. All that matters is that we complete all the updates. This makes it an obvious target for aggregation. The histogram application when written with exstack looks a little more complicated...

    while( exstack_proceed(ex, (i==T)) ){
      for( ; i < T; i++){
        col = pckindx[i] >> 16;
        pe  = pckindx[i] & 0xffff;
        if( !exstack_push(ex, &col, pe) )
          break;
      }
      
      exstack_exchange(ex);
    
      while((colp = exstack_pull(ex, NULL)))
        lcounts[*colp]++;
    }
