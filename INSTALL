# See the bale documentation for more information about what bale is.
#
# The main components are :
#  INSTALL       # This file
#  libgetput     # parallel programming utility lib
#  exstack       # the exstack and exstack2 libraries
#  convey-0.4.3b # directory containing the conveyor buffering model
#  spmat         # the sparse matrix library
#  apps          # the applications directory, includes histogram, indexgather, toposort, and others
#  install.sh    # an install script
#  Doxyfile      # A key to building the documentation with doxygen (see more below).
#  mainpage.h    # The main documentation page.
#
# The codes are in C and all except conveyors use the libgetput library for a parallel API.
# Everything can be built on UPC or SHMEM. We have tested with Cray UPC (cce 8.7.3). We have
# done some testing with Cray SHMEM (7.7.2), Berkeley UPC (with CLANG UPC compiler bupc/2.24.2.5201)
# and OpenShmem (2.1.0).
#
#  The models used are:
#  agi      : standard PGAS model that uses puts, gets, and atomics
#  exstack  : a bulk synchronous buffering model
#  exstack2 : a asynchronous variant of exstack
#  conveyors: a asynchronous model that is independent of exstack and exstack2. 
#             The user interface is similar to exstack2.             
#
# ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION ###########################################
#
# For this document, let BALEDIR = the directory containing this file.
# We handle building on multiple architectures by setting an environment variable PLATFORM and then
# building in the directory BALEDIR/build_$PLATFORM.
# If you don't set this, your platform will be set to "unknown".
#
# You can build bale on top of UPC or SHMEM. 
#
# UPC:   You should set the UPC environment variable to point to the UPC compiler and 
#          the UPCFLAGS variable to whatever options you pass to the compiler (for example:
#          UPCFLAGS="-gupc -network=ibv".
# SHMEM: If you are using openshmem, set CC=oshcc (the openshmem compiler).
#

# BUILD AND INSTALL ###################################################
#
# bale uses autotools. To make building and
# installing easier, we have included the install.sh script. Simply run
# the install.sh script. This script visits each subpackage in bale and
# runs configure, make, and make install. You could of course do this
# yourself. The default build and install directory is
# $BALEDIR/build_$PLATFORM. There are several important options for the
# script...

# -u OR -s : specify you would like to build libgetput on top of UPC or SHMEM. default: UPC
# -p : specify an alternate install dir
# -f : run autoreconf steps also
# -c : specify options to configure step

# We use a separate build directory for each architecture. 
# The configure process creates architecture depend files (e.g. Makefile)
# it also creates symbolic links back to the source. This allows us to
# rename files to satisfy various compilers (e.g. 
# some compilers require that UPC programs end in .upc)
#
# DOCUMENTATION #####################################################
#
# Bale is documented using Doxygen. To generate the html documentation you must have 
# doxygen on your system (I recommend version 1.8.6). To generate the docs, simply change
# to the $BALEDIR directory and type:
#
# doxygen
#
# Then navigate your browser to $BALEDIR/html/index.html.
