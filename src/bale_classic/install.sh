# NOTES on using this script:
# You should define an environment variable called PLATFORM that describes your machine.
# In the bale source directory type
#   sh install.sh [options]
# That will create a build directory called build_PLATFORM in the bale source directory.
#
# The installed libraries and binaries will go in build_PLATFORM/lib and build_PLATFORM/bin respectively.
#
# If you are on a machine with Open Shmem you need to add -c "LIBS=-loshmem" as an option.
# If you want to turn on debugging, you can add -c "CFLAGS=-g".
