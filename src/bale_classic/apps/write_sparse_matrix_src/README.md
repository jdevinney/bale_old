# Write Sparse Matrix

This sounds like a very simple task -- write a sparse matrix to disk. However, we throw in a twist. bale sparse matrices are stored so that the rows are distributed to PEs in CYCLIC order (that means rows i, i + THREADS, i + 2*THREADS... are local to PE i; this is a contrast to BLOCK layout where PEs get continguous sets of rows). There are pros and cons to CYCLIC and BLOCK layouts, One of the nice features of CYCLIC layout is that nonzeros tend to be better load balanced to PEs. 

We would like to be able to write a sparse matrix in a way such that we can read it back in on any number of PEs easily. This is one of the pros to BLOCK layout. It is very easy to write a matrix in BLOCK layout just by having each PE dump their data to disk. This data is also very easy to read back into BLOCK layout, using any number of PEs.

We would also like the data to be laid out in row-major order on disk. That would make it more convenient to explore the data on disk if necessary. Both of these goals are automatically and easily achieved using BLOCK layout. However, as we mentioned, CYCLIC layout has its perks too. We would like to be able to read and write matrices from/to CYCLIC layout with any numbers of PEs.

## Writing

One way to do this task would be to shuffle rows from CYCLIC layout to BLOCK layout and then just dump the data. That motivates how the bale implementations of write sparse matrix work. As described this sounds just like the [permute_matrix](../permute_matrix_src/README.md) app. However, we what if we do not want to allocate the space to store an entire second copy of the matrix just to write the matrix to disk? We need to send the rows in batches to the PE that would own them if the matrix were in BLOCK layout and write small buffers of data. This is where the challenge of this application comes in. We need to send just the right data so that each PE is able to fill a buffer with the next data it is supposed to write. 

## Reading

Though we do not have a read_sparse_matrix in bale yet, such an app would be very similar to the write_sparse_matrix app. PEs would read some amount of the on disk data and farm it out to the PEs who own that data in CYCLIC layout. 

## Other thoughts

Another idea for the write is to always just dump the data in CYCLIC layout. Then when reading back in, the PEs need to figure out which rows they read and where those rows go. This can be tricky since the rows are laid out in a way that depends on the number of writing PEs and the communication pattern during the read depends on the number of PEs used to write and how many are reading.
