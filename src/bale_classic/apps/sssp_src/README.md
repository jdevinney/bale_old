# Single Source Shortest Path  (sssp)

## Definition
We are given a directed graph with non-negative edge weights *c(v,w)*
and an given source vertex, *v_0*.
We wish to find the lightest weighted path from *v_0* to all other vertices,
where the weight of a path is the sum of the weights of the edges in the path.

## Discussion
This is well studied problem.
It is used in classes on algorithms, data structures, and graph theory.
It is also used as a benchmark in Graph500 benchmark suite.
We are using this problem to evaluate what we have learned about our programming models.
Are approach is that of someone given the assignment to get an SSSP application
running reasonable well, at scale, using our programming models.

We consider three algorithms: Dijsktra's, Delta-Stepping, and Bellman-Ford.
Good references for these uses are easily found online.
We are using the Meyer/Sanders 
[delta-stepping algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196677403000762).

These algorithm work by assign a tentative weight, *tent(v)*, to each vertex. 
Initially the weight of the given vertex is zero and all other weights are set to infinity.
The algorithms proceed by changing the state of the vertices 
from *unreached* (with infinite weight)
to *unsettled* 
to *settled* (meaning that the lightest weight path to that vertex is known). 
The vertices change state via the process of *relaxing edges*.
Relaxing an edge *(v,w)* replaces *tent(w)* with the *min(tent(w), tent(v)+c(v,w))*.

There is subtle relationship between the length of a path
(the number of edge in the path) and the weight of the path.
Clearly, it is possible to have a longer path that is lighter than a shorter.
If a path from *v0* to *w* contains the vertice *v*, then the weight of the path
from *v0* to *v* is less than the path from *v0* thru *v* to *w*.
If *v* is an intermediate vertex on a lightest path from *v0* to *w*,
then the path from $v0$ to $v$ is also a lightest path.

Dijsktra's algorithm works by considering the weight *tent(v)* of the "unsettled" vertices.
One proves that lightest such vertex does, in fact, have the correct weight.
So, that vertex can be "settled" and we need only relax edges from that vertex.
This gives the most efficent algorithm in the sense that edges are relaxed exactly once.

Bellman-Ford relaxes edges based on the length of paths 
to the "unsettled" and "unreached" vertices.
Basically the algorithm is to relax all of the edges in the graph until none of the
tentative weights *tent(v)* change. 

The Meyer/Sanders delta-stepping algorithm uses ideas from both of the previous algorithms.
Unsettled vertices are kept in "buckets" based on their by *tent(v)* value; bucket *i*
contains vertices with *tent(v)* at least _i\*delta_ and less than _(i+1)\*delta_, 
where *delta* is a parameter.  The active bucket is the *i*th bucket (with the smallest *i*)
that has unsettled vertices.  Edges in the graph are considered light if their weight 
is less than or equal to *delta* and heavy otherwise.

The algorithm "settles" the vertices in that active bucket with a Bellman-Ford approach
using only the light edges. Then the algorithm relaxes the vertices that were in the active
bucket using the heavy. This uses an extension of Dijsktra's approach because the 
heavy edges cannot put vertices into the active bucket.  The efficiency of the algorithm
comes at the price of a more complicate flow control and data-structure manipulations
to maintain the buckets.

We have implementations of Delta-Stepping and Bellman-Ford in this directory.
We also have implementations of all three algorithms in the other_serial/C "cousin" 
directory and the delta-stepping algorithm in the other_serial/Rust and other_parallel/Rust directories.

#### Parallel Considerations
Dijsktra's algorithm is a serial algorithm, 
with no opportunity for our static thread based parallelism. 
One must find *the* single lightest *tent(v)* and then relax the edges from that *v*.
In addition, serial versions of the algorithm can use a priority queue to efficient
the next unsettled vertex. In our C implementation we use a simple binary heap.
Depending on the average degree of a vertex, one could imagine relaxing the edges
in parallel with a fork-join threading model, but one still has to have an 
efficient way to find the smallest weight unsettled vertex.

Bellman-Ford does a lot of redundant relaxations. We attempt to limit the amount of 
redundant work with a dynamic programming approach, but it still seems to be over-whelming.
In it favor, it has trivial flow control, no data structure manipulations 
and massive amounts of parallelism. 

The delta-stepping algorithm has a tunable amount of parallelism that depends on *delta*.
The more vertices that are in the active bucket the more relaxations,
possibly redundant relaxations, that can be done in a parallel.
Note that the heavy edges are relaxed only once and they are done as a batch
of all the heavy edges from any vertex that was in the active bucket.

The parallelism available in the Bellman-Ford and Delta-stepping algorithms
is a natural fit to our buffered communication.
A thread with affinity to the tail of an edge knows the *tent(v)* 
of a vertex and the weight of the outgoing edges from *v*. It is responsible
for picking which edges to relax.  A thread with affinity to the head
of an edge knows whether or not the relaxation improves *tent(w)* of the head
and then updates data structures accordingly.

#### Why it is in bale?
This problem and the different algorithms give a new use case to study programming models.
The Bellman-Ford is simple algorithm, but it requires an atomic min of a double to 
perform the relaxations in parallel.  We do not yet have a working AGP implementation
of atomic_min_double, hence we do not have a AGP version of Bellman-Ford.

Unlike the other bale apps, the Delta-stepping algorithm performs as much work
remotely as it does locally.

We haven't started analysing these implementations yet.

#### From the Book?
We don't think there's an FTB version of any of these algorithms using the AGP model.
