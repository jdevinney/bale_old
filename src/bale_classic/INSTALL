#
# ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION ###########################################
#
# For this document, let BALEDIR = the directory containing this file.
# We handle building on multiple architectures by setting an environment variable PLATFORM and then
# building in the directory BALEDIR/build_$PLATFORM.
# If you don't set this, your platform will be set to "unknown".
#
# You can build bale on top of UPC or SHMEM. 
#
# UPC:   You should set the UPC environment variable to point to the UPC compiler and 
#        the UPCFLAGS variable to whatever options you pass to the compiler (for example:
#        UPCFLAGS="-gupc -network=ibv".
# SHMEM: If you are using openshmem, set CC=oshcc (the openshmem compiler).
#
#
# BUILD AND INSTALL ###################################################
#
# bale uses autotools.
#
# To make building and installing easier, we have included a few scripts.
#
# First, in the bale_classic directory, run the run_autoreconf script.
#
# Next, simply run the install.sh script. This script visits each
# subpackage in bale and runs configure, make, and make install. You
# could of course do this yourself. The default build and install
# directory is $BALEDIR/build_$PLATFORM. There are several important
# options for the script...
#
# -u OR -s : specify you would like to build libgetput on top of UPC or SHMEM. default: UPC
# -p : specify an alternate install dir
# -f : run autoreconf steps also
# -c : specify options to configure step
# -m : just make, don't configure
#
# We use a separate build directory for each architecture. 
# The configure process creates architecture depend files (e.g. Makefile)
# it also creates symbolic links back to the source. This allows us to
# rename files to satisfy various compilers (e.g. 
# some compilers require that UPC programs end in .upc)
#
# If you are interested in optimizing the conveyor code, after running install.sh
# once (or otherwise building the subpackages) go into build_$PLATFORM/convey
# and run 'make tune' with the LAUNCH variable set to a command prefix for
# launching a parallel job of a size you care about.  For example:
#
# make tune LAUNCH="srun -n512"
#
# The tuning should take a few minutes.  After it finishes, you can return to
# this directory and run ./install.sh with the -m option (in addition to any
# previously used options) to rebuild everything without reconfiguring.  See
# also the AUTOTUNING section of convey/INSTALL.
#
#
# Installing on Mac OS X ########################################
#
# This is a bit tricky :)
#
# 1. install osx compiling environment, bring up the mac app store and install xcode
#    After installation you need to accept the license:
#
# % sudo xcodebuild -license
#
# 2. to get autotools, best to use brew (https://brew.sh):
#
# % brew install autoconf
# % brew install automake
# % brew install libtool
#
# 3. to get clang-upc, which seems to run well, go to:
#     https://clangupc.github.io/clang-upc/install.html
#    and follow the directions. You will need to do
#
# % brew install cmake
#
#    to get this to work.  On recent OS X versions (10.15, maybe 10.14) you need
#    to pass another argument to cmake: -DDEFAULT_SYSROOT:STRING="$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)"
#
# 4. to use shmem, SOS openShmem seems best for now.  Go to:
#     https://github.com/Sandia-OpenSHMEM/SOS/wiki/OFI-Build-Instructions
#    and follow the directions.  For recent versions OS X (10.15, maybe 10.14) you
#    need to set an environment variable before runnig anything will work.
#     export SHMEM_OFI_DOMAIN=lo0
#    performance is horrid because it only has a socket based implementation
#
# 5. when using the runit.sh script with clang, you need to say
#     ./runit.sh -l $PWD/clang_upc_run.sh -c 2
#    Note that -c should be small but not less than 2, otherwise some things hang
#
# DOCUMENTATION #####################################################
#
# Bale is documented using Doxygen. To generate the html documentation you must have 
# doxygen on your system (I recommend version 1.8.6). To generate the docs, simply change
# to the $BALEDIR directory and type:
#
# doxygen
#
# Then navigate your browser to $BALEDIR/html/index.html.
