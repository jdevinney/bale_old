// then copy[my_rank] would be MY_PROC.)  The 'friends' array is absorbed
// by the porter.
//
// The 'multiplicity' is the number of buffers per friend; it must be a
// power of two.  The 'opcode' is used for mpp profiling of buffer sends.
// The recognized options are: convey_opt_DYNAMIC, convey_opt_PROGRESS,
// convey_opt_ALERT, and also porter_opt_LOCAL, which indicates that
// communication is thought to be within a node.  The tag_bytes value,
// which must be 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8, determines the format of buffer data.

// hold each item is rounded up (if tag_bytes > 0) to a multiple of
