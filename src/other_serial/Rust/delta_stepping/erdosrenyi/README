The files are

er_nn_prob.mm
er_nn_prob.wts

Note the matrices are for a directed graph with some loops.
Still got to work on this, but loops of positive weight 
should never get used.
Or I could fix the code :) 


The wts weights file is just num of entry and then entries 
one per line.

JG: I added two sparser ER graphs, called sparse100 and sparse200
