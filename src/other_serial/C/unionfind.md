## unionfind
### Definition
Use the unionfind data structure to implement the 
union of disjoint sets approach to finding the connect components in a simple graph.

### Algorithms


### Discussion
This is here cause we can't do it parallel.
Not like Dijsktra's or randperm that ARE serial.
Keeping the data structure consistent with parallel changes to it seems overwhelming.
