## spmat_utils

### Definition
The definitions and a few sparse matrices routines we use in these apps.

### Discussion
Compared to libraries bale_classic this is a trivial library. 
This is not a general library; we only include routines need to support the
apps in this directory.  We simply took the `spmat_utils` and `libgetput`
libraries of bale_classic and deleted the shared memory and threaded
communication code.
